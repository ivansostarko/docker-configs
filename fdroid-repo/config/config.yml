# F-Droid repo configuration (binary repo)
#
# You must set repo_url to the exact public URL where clients can fetch the repo.
# Recommended convention: https://<domain>/fdroid/repo/
repo_url: "https://example.com/fdroid/repo"
repo_name: "My Private F-Droid Repo"
repo_description: "Internal distribution of APKs."
repo_icon: "icon.png"

# Where fdroidserver finds APKs and writes indexes (relative to /repo)
repo_dir: "repo"

# Metadata directory (relative to /repo); bind-mounted from ./config/metadata
metadata_dir: "metadata"

# Signing / keystore
# These are paths inside the container; this compose mounts them as Docker secrets.
keystore: "/run/secrets/fdroid_keystore"
repo_keyalias: "myrepo"

# IMPORTANT:
# Some fdroidserver versions expect keystore passwords in config.yml (plaintext).
# Do NOT commit plaintext passwords. If you hit that requirement:
# - best: sign on a separate restricted builder, then publish the signed repo artifacts
# - acceptable: generate a runtime-only config inside the container from secrets (see README)
